This document just talks about some basic concepts.
The [examples](../example/) give you a more concrete and intuitive understanding,
after reading this document.
Here is a [playgound](https://play.phorklift.org) where you can try the
configurations online.


# It's in Lua

Phorklift embeds [Lua](https://lua.org), so Lua is the most natural choice
for configuration.

Lua is powerful but also simple. It's even simpler if just for configuration.
Compared with other configuration languages, Lua has the following features:

- Single line comments start with `--`, and block comments start with `--[[`
  and run until the corresponding `]]`.

- Table type can mix array members and key-value entries. Constructors `{}`
  create and initialize tables, where members are separated by `,` or `;`.

- Function type gives great flexibility to the configuration.


# Pre-defined Functions

An Phorklift configuration is a valid Lua script, with some pre-defined functions:

- Runtime
- Listen
- Host
- Path

They are loaded by Phorklift before loading the configuration file.

`Runtime` accepts a table argument.
In Lua, if the function has one single argument and this argument is either
a literal string or a table constructor, then the parentheses are optional.
So the parentheses are always omitted for Runtime:

  ```lua
  Runtime {
      worker = 4
  }
  ```

The other 3 functions are a little more complex. It seems that they accept
one or more string arguments and a final table argument, like this:

  ```lua
  Listen "8081" "8081" "8082" { -- 3 string arguments and 1 table argument
      echo = "hello, world!\n",
  }
  ```

In fact [their definitions](../src/phl_conf_predefs.lua) are a little more
complex than what they look like. But you don't need to care about this.


# Scope

Each pre-defined function defines a scope.

`Runtime` is for global settings, such as worker numbers. There could be one
or none Runtime in a configuration.

`Listen` is at the top level. There could be one or more Listens
in a configuration.

`Host` must be in the Listen scope. There could be none or one or more Hosts in
a Listen scope. If none, then a default Host is used, just like the
"hello world" example above. If any, then they work as virtual servers.

`Path` could be in the Host or Listen scope. There could be none or one or more
Paths in a Host or Listen scope. If none, then a default Path is used, just like the
"hello world" example above. If any, then they work as routers on requests' URLs.


# Command's Scope

Each configuration command belongs to one specific scope. For example `networks`
belongs to Listen, and `echo` belongs to Path.

The high-level commands can not appear in low-level scope because it does
not make sense.
However low-level commands can appear in high-level scope to define the
the default value for all the low-level scopes under this high-level scope.

For example, `networks` can not appear in the Host or Path scope.
But `echo` can appear in Listen and Host scope, just like the "hello world"
example above.


# A Syntactic Sugar

If seeing the [configuration reference](4.conf_reference.md), you will find
that `echo` accepts table type value. It also accepts a `status_code`
option in the table. But in the "hello world" example above, it's set a string
value.

This is Phorklift's syntactic sugar. You can omit the table constructor and set a
member directly, if

- the value table accepts array members (either single or multiple),
- the type of array member is not table again,
- you want to set only one array member,
- you do not want to set any key-value entry.

In Phorklift, if a command accepts table type value, with both array members and
key-value entries, then the array members are decisive while the
key-value entries are optional in most cases. So this syntactic sugar is
used frequently.

The `echo` in the "hello world" example above is a classic example.
