  + `uri_args` _(table)_ arguments in URI query string
  + `uri_raw` _(string)_ raw request URI, including query string

Methods:

  + `set_uri_path (path)` Rewrite URI path.
  + `get_uri_arg (name) => value`
  + `get_body_arg (name) => value`

  + `get_header (name) => value`

# package: `resp`

# package: `ups`

Create upstream to manage connections. All upstream's features can be used,

The connection methods can use Lua's syntactic sugar, such as `phl.ups.close(c)`
is same with `c:close()`.

Methods:

  + `getc (upstream) => c` Argument `upstream` can be a address(string) or upstream configuration(table).
  + `send (c, data) => ok`
  + `recv_size (c, size) => data`
  + `keepalive (c)` Put into pool.
  + `close (c)`

# package: `redis`

TODO lack of documents

Constants:
